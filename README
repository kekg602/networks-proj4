To approach this project my partner and I first worked on getting the initial GET request working. Once this was successful and we received the HTML response we tackled how to parse through this HTML. We used the html parser library available in Python and were able to grab the important data from the HTML. For the initial GET request it was important to get the csrf token and the session id. We then used this information, in addition to the entered username and password, to send a POST request and login to Fakebook. After successfully logging in we began the cycle of parsing through HTML to find more valid urls to search and the secret flags. Once the 5 secret flags are found the program is done.
